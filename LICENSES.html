 * Uses IOKit to figure out the idle time of the system. The idle time
 * is stored as a property of the IOHIDSystem class; the name is
 * HIDIdleTime. Stored as a 64-bit int, measured in ns.
 *
 * The program itself just prints to stdout the time that the computer has
 * been idle in seconds.

 * Compile with gcc -Wall -framework IOKit -framework Carbon idler.c -o
