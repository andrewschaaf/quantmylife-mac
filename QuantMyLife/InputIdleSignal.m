// The following method uses code from idler.c

/*****************************************
 * idler.c
 *
 * Uses IOKit to figure out the idle time of the system. The idle time
 * is stored as a property of the IOHIDSystem class; the name is
 * HIDIdleTime. Stored as a 64-bit int, measured in ns.
 *
 * The program itself just prints to stdout the time that the computer
 has
 * been idle in seconds.
 *
 * Compile with gcc -Wall -framework IOKit -framework Carbon idler.c -o
 * idler
